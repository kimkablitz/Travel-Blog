### Travel-Blog
A summary of my backpacking trips through Asia and Europes, new perespective of a young woman of color traveling into different lands.

### Goal
* Do not leave a stone uncovered. 

### Rules
* In Rome do as the Romans and I wanted the experience of a local other than a tourist. By speaking several languages and having a rather universal look I was able to disguise myself and was generally accepted by the locals. Especially in Asia and Central America, I have made friends that sheltered me, willing to share their beds and going through journeys together.
